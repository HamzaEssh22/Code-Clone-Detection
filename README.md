# Code-Clone-Detection

The document provides a comprehensive overview of the project and the approaches utilized.

The README file outlines the packages used for each approach:

Approach 1: This method involves data preprocessing, code embedding using a pre-trained language model (CodeBERT), and training a machine learning classifier to predict code similarity.

Approach 2: This method includes data preprocessing, fine-tuning CodeBERT, and creating a neural network classifier. (Note: This approach does not yield satisfactory results.)

Approach 3: This method employs a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) based approach to detect code clones.
